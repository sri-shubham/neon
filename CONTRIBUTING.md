### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Look for existing issues or pull requests
2. **Open an issue**: For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. **Keep it focused**: Make small, focused changes rather than large, sweeping ones

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your fork**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout master
   git merge upstream/master
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)

4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   go test -race ./...
   ```

5. **Update documentation** if necessary

### Submitting the Pull Request

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```

```

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Use `golint` and `go vet` to check for issues
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful names

### Code Quality Tools

Run these tools before submitting:

```bash
# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Vet code
go vet ./...

# Run golangci-lint (if available)
golangci-lint run
```

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful package and variable names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Group related functionality together

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All new code must have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for new features
- **Coverage**: Maintain 100% test coverage where possible
- **Performance**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

### Test Structure

```go
func TestFeatureName(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange
    // ... setup test data
    
    // Act
    // ... call the function being tested
    
    // Assert
    // ... verify the results
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestSpecificFunction

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=.
```

## Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **README**: Keep the main README.md updated
- **Code Comments**: Document all exported functions and types
- **Examples**: Include practical examples in documentation
- **API Docs**: Use godoc format for API documentation

### Updating Documentation

When making changes:

1. Update relevant documentation
2. Add examples for new features
3. Update the README.md if necessary
4. Ensure all code is properly commented
